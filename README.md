# SORAL_Archived

This repository is a copy of a single checkout I once did of the subversion
repository of SORAL, the Search Optimization and Resource Allocation Library.

SORAL was created as a project by Charles Twardy, from whose
[SARBayes.org](http://sarbayes.org) web site once hosted the SORAL
source code.  Unfortunately, Charles' hosting provider disappeared
without warning, taking with it the entire subversion repository of
SORAL.  It is still possible to find a copy of SORAL via the "Wayback
machine" but all of the project history is pretty much lost.

In order to make SORAL available in a maintained repository, I've
simply taken an old copy (lacking all subversion history) and uploaded
it to github.  I claim no ownership of this code, and have contributed
essentially nothing to it but one bug fix.  I find it very useful,
however, and don't want it lost for real.

## This repo is now just a historical artifact

Since I have created this archived repository, Charles Twardy has
created an official repository for SORAL, which may be found on github
at https://github.com/ctwardy/soral.  All future official development
and maintenance of SORAL will occur in that repo.
